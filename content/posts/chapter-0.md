> Like every good book, we begin at chapter 0.

The day is Saturday May 9th, and we are still in lockdown due to COVID-19.
During this lockdown I decided to take advantage and pick up some new skills...
Networking skills to be exact. I have set a goal to obtain my [CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html).
This gave me the idea to start blogging about my learning and possibly help others along the way. This blog wil not be limited to CCNA/Networking but to everything tech related that interests me.
