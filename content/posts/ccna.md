After about a week of impatiently waiting, my book and hardware finally arrived.
I dug into the intro of the book... and let me tell you this thing is **MASSIVE**.
After quickly speeding through all the pages I got a rough idea of all the topics.  

Since the book is my primary source of learning, it makes sense that I will follow the books chapters in order with my topics.
It does not follow the order of the exam but I find it more logical in a way. ðŸ––  

I did not book an exam date or plan out my whole learning schedule, because I am in no rush; and besides the testing center near me is closed anyways.
I rather go through and learn everything really well... not to mention it is a ton of info to take in. I have heard of _stories_ of people completing it in 30 days.

Below are the topics and order I will traverse them. I may split some out into sub-topics if there is too much information.

## Topics I will cover
- Introduction to Networking
- Implementing Ethernet LANs
- Implementing VLANs and STP
- IPv4 Addressing
- IPv4 Routing
- OSPF
- IP Version 6
- Wireless LANs
- IP Access Control Lists
- Security Services
- IP Services
- Network Architecture
- Network Automation

Let the games begin!
